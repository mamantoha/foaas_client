    # Macros in Crystal are a great way of writing DRY code, its almost like using a
    # templating language to write your code. I think the best way to understand is
    # to simply show some code.

    # Here is a macro which looping through the `Foaas::Client::OPERATIONS` hash
    # to define 99 *beautiful* methods for each operation.
    #
    # By the way, macros are evaluated at compile-time, meaning that they have no performance penalty.
    #
    # Macros should be just strong enough to reduce boilerplate code.
